# angular-rating
The first fully customizable AngularJS rating system that is as easy as it gets.

Its best feature? It works with any icon from font-awesome, even if you want it 'half'!

[Live demo here](https://jsfiddle.net/filipetedim/0595783t/)!

## Getting started

Install the package using Bower:
```bash
bower install angular-rating
```

Include the files in your index page:
```javascript
// CSS
<link rel="stylesheet" href="angular-rating/dist/angular-rating.min.css">

// JavaScript
<script src="angular-rating/dist/angular-rating.min.js">
```

Add the module to your main module's list of dependencies:
```javascript
angular.module('yourApp', [
	// ...
	'angular-rating',
	// ...
]);
```
